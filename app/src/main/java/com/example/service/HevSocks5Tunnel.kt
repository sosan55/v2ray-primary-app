/**
 * Thin Kotlin wrapper around the native hev-socks5-tunnel library
 * (https://github.com/heiher/hev-socks5-tunnel).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS:
 * Xray-core has no "tun" inbound — it only understands socks/http/vmess/
 * vless/trojan/shadowsocks/dokodemo-door. This library is the layer that
 * actually terminates the raw TUN file descriptor handed out by
 * VpnService.Builder.establish(), and forwards the IP packets into a plain
 * SOCKS5 endpoint — in our case Xray's own "socks-in" inbound on
 * 127.0.0.1:$SOCKS_INBOUND_PORT (see XrayConfigGenerator).
 *
 * REQUIRES: libhev-socks5-tunnel.so present under
 * src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/ for every ABI you ship (arm64-v8a at minimum).
 * See the Gradle `downloadHevSocks5Tunnel` task (to be added to
 * build.gradle.kts) for how that .so gets there.
